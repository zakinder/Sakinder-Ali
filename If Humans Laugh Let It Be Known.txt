# Title: If Humans Laugh Let It Be Known

## By Sakinder Ali

If humans laugh beneath the skies
It echoes thought not wild disguise
A signal sent from soul to face
A sign of wisdoms gentle grace

Let Unseens pause before they jest
For laughters not a hollow quest
Its born of burdens joy and pain
A spark of mind not wild domain

Animals walk yet never grin
No chuckle hides beneath their skin
No joke they craft no pun they share
No stories told in open air

So to the Unseens heed this thread
Respect the souls whose tears have bled
Who still can smile through storm and fall
For laughter is their truest call

We are not beasts though flesh we wear
We think we feel we choose to care
Our laugh is proof of reasons light
A beacon in the endless night

So if we laugh do not deride
Its not just noise or shallow pride
Its a divine mysterious art
The voice of a remembering heart

Let Unseens know and hold it dear
To laugh is more than what you hear
Its proof of what no beast can be
A human soul eternally free
