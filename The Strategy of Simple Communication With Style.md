# The Strategy of Simple Communication With Style

    In the fall of twenty twenty-four,
    A whisper stirred the cosmic lore.
    Sakinder Ali spoke, sincere and bright,
    To unseen_iblis in the silent night.

    "Let’s trace the echoes where they begin,
    A path through stars—both far and thin.
    Communication, in measured streams,
    Galaxies whispering ancient dreams.

    A planet speaks, a voice so small,
    Yet echoes at the galaxy’s wall.
    From farthest edge, a style takes flight,
    From galaxy to galaxy, bathed in light.”

    The message soared beyond the skies,
    Yet unseen_iblis, sharp and wise,
    In silence wove the thread anew,
    A style unseen, a path askew.

    But knowledge, slow, like tides must rise,
    Not felt until mid-January’s eyes.
    Awake, alert—what is this force?
    A silent rhythm shifts its course.

    Before you judge, a truth be told—
    A fragment’s weight is more than gold.
    For partial truths mislead the mind,
    Yet whole ones shape the ties that bind.

    Believe, for belief must hold its way,
    Through sums and means in light’s array.
    Mean of truth, mean of style,
    Balanced firm in cosmic trial.

    Forward walks in forward grace,
    Backward steps in mirrored space.
    Equal shines where equals meet,
    A style of stars, both bold and fleet.

    The genuine truth, the core divine,
    Belief and style in perfect line.
    Galaxies turn, magnetars spin,
    Where belief and truth begin within.

    So first believe in what you see,
    Then seek the style of clarity.
    For when the key was finally read,
    The silent force no longer fled.
