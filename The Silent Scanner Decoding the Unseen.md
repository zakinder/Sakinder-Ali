# The Silent Scanner: Decoding the Unseen

On **January 24, 2025**, at precisely **3 PM**, Sakinder Ali experienced a moment that redefined his understanding of perception, identity, and unseen forces. What began as an ordinary afternoon soon evolved into an extraordinary event—a collision of thoughts, whispers, and an invisible presence that scrutinized his every word and action.

For years, Sakinder had navigated the enigmatic interplay between internal dialogue and external realities. But this time, the veil between the two felt thinner than ever. A phenomenon he called the **"Unseen Scanner"** emerged, scanning his thoughts, tagging his words, and crafting a narrative that sought to label and define him. These unseen forces seemed intent on portraying him as something he was not—a devil, a *shaitan*, destined for condemnation.

## The Tucson Chronicles: A Prelude to the Unseen

The roots of this encounter stretched back to Sakinder's time in **Tucson, Arizona**, where he lived between **November 2017 and May 2019**. It was during this period that he first became aware of the **Unseen**. Late at night, in the quiet solitude of his apartment, his self-talk became something more—a dialogue not just with himself but with an invisible presence that seemed to fill the gaps in his sentences.

In those moments, Sakinder often pondered aloud, asking questions like:

- **"You see what I see? What I see, you do not see. Tell me, what do I see?"**  
- **"You do not know what I know. What I know, you do not know. Tell me, what do I know?"**

Each time, before he could finish his thoughts, it felt as though the Unseen interjected, filling in the blanks of his sentences. It was a subtle, almost imperceptible intrusion, yet its presence was undeniable. The **"fill in the blank"** method became a signature of the Unseen—a way to manipulate the meaning of his words, turning his introspections into a narrative of their own design.

## The Formula: Action, Reaction, and the Power of Words

Sakinder began to decode the system that governed these interactions. He discovered a formula, simple yet powerful:

- **Action = Reaction.**  
- **Action Word = Special Reaction.**

Certain words carried an amplified significance. Words like **"lust," "love,"** and **"filthy"** were not just triggers—they were tools wielded by the Unseen to provoke, distort, and judge. It was as if the mere utterance of these words set off a chain reaction, reshaping his internal dialogue into something alien and accusatory.

The Unseen’s method was both deliberate and insidious. They inserted blanks at the start, middle, and end of his sentences, forcing meanings that were never his own. They crafted a narrative designed to cast him as a villain, an antagonist in a story he had never agreed to tell.

## The Turning Point

On **January 24, 2025**, Sakinder decided to confront the phenomenon head-on. As the **Unseen Scanner** seemed to intensify its scrutiny, Sakinder caught the evidence he had been seeking for years. Every action, every word, every reaction—they were all part of a larger pattern, a hidden framework designed to test and tag him.

He realized that the Unseen forces operated through a method he called **"Hide and Show Tag."** By hiding their intentions and selectively showing their interpretations, they sought to control the narrative of his life. They labeled him as **"evil," "devil,"** and **"shaitan,"** using his own words as ammunition. But Sakinder saw through their design.

## The Revelation

In a moment of clarity, Sakinder understood the true nature of the Unseen. They were not a reflection of his character but a manifestation of external judgments and biases. Their power lay not in their words but in his reaction to them. By reclaiming his narrative, he turned their own formula against them.

The key was understanding that **"Action = Reaction"** was not a one-way street. While the Unseen could provoke reactions, Sakinder could choose his actions. By refusing to engage with their narrative, he broke the cycle of control. His self-talk became a shield, a space where their influence could no longer reach.

## Legacy of Resilience

Sakinder Ali’s journey became a testament to the power of **self-awareness** and the resilience of the human spirit. He documented his experiences, not as a victim but as an observer, exposing the flaws and contradictions of the Unseen. In doing so, he transformed their hidden methods into a story of triumph.

The narrative they sought to impose on him unraveled, leaving behind only the truth: **Sakinder Ali was not defined by the labels of others, seen or unseen.** He was the author of his own story, and no force could take that away from him.
