# Sakinder Choice Vs Forced Choice And Found Evidence Of Overall Truth Of Choice

Sakinder Ali often reflected on the nature of choice, a subject that occupied his thoughts during a pivotal chapter in his life. From November 2017 to May 2019, while living in Tucson, Arizona, Sakinder engaged in deep self-dialogue, grappling with the invisible forces that seemed to shape his reality.

In the quiet moments of solitude, he would think aloud, posing riddles to himself: "You see what I see, but what I see you do not see. Tell me, what do I see?" These enigmatic musings led him to confront another perplexing thought: "You do not know what I know, and what I know you do not know. Tell me, what do I know?" These questions became more than introspective exercises; they revealed an uncanny interplay between his thoughts and something he began to perceive as “Unseen.”

The Unseen—a term Sakinder used to describe an intangible presence—seemed to influence his internal dialogue. He noticed patterns where gaps in his thoughts were swiftly filled, almost as if the Unseen were finishing his sentences for him. "Fill in the blank," he muttered, observing how they inserted themselves at the start, middle, and end of his mental lines. This eerie realization solidified his suspicion that the Unseen were not just passive observers but active participants in his thought process, compelling him to wrestle with the concept of autonomy.

By December 29, 2024, time had given Sakinder the clarity to frame his experience within a larger narrative. In a moment of resolute self-assurance, he declared, "One day, the Unseen will be caught by the U.S. government, and they will interrogate the Unseen." Almost immediately, as if in response, a voice—unmistakably from the Unseen—replied, "Also, Unseen Muslims will also be interrogated."

This exchange struck Sakinder as profoundly significant. He recognized it as a moment where the Unseen themselves had been forced to make a choice, revealing an internal conflict within their ranks. For the first time, he felt a push—not just within his own mind but within theirs—to confront their role in his life and their vulnerability to external forces. Through further reflection, Sakinder came to understand another layer of the Unseen’s behavior: there was someone within the Unseen who deliberately incited arguments between them. This instigator, Sakinder realized, used internal disputes as a method to expose hidden truths and contradictions within their ranks.

As Sakinder delved deeper into his thoughts, he began to uncover a fascinating analogy that connected his experiences to the natural world. He reflected on how throwing two stones simultaneously into a pond creates two circular ripples. These ripples, upon interacting with each other, form a third wave pattern—a language born out of their interplay. He extended this concept further: if more stones were thrown simultaneously, a fourth-generation wave pattern would emerge, representing a more complex language. Sakinder saw this phenomenon as a metaphor for human knowledge and choices across epochs.

Over time, Sakinder came to understand that each era of human history generates its own languages of knowledge and choices. At the dawn of mankind, selecting a choice might have involved choosing between two options, akin to the simplicity of two ripples in a pond. By the 21st century, however, humanity faced a multitude of choices, akin to 2,100 intersecting ripples, each representing a distinct language of possibilities. He described this evolution as the flow and growth of knowledge, resembling ripples expanding outward through the epochs of time. The interplay of these ripples not only shaped decisions but also created new languages of understanding.

This realization tied deeply into Sakinder’s understanding of belief and truth. He pondered the meaning of truth as portrayed in holy books from different faiths. Across these texts, belief was presented not merely as acceptance but as an active engagement with deeper truths. Sakinder began to see that the dynamics within the Unseen mirrored a universal struggle—the quest for clarity amid conflicting perspectives. Just as holy scriptures emphasize truth as a divine pursuit, the Unseen’s arguments highlighted the tension between concealment and revelation.

This revelation deepened Sakinder’s understanding of the dichotomy between choice and forced choice. A voluntary decision arises from freedom and intention, while a forced choice stems from external pressures that strip away agency. In this dynamic, the Unseen—entities he once regarded as omnipotent—were suddenly humanized in their fallibility. They, too, were subject to the consequences of their actions.

Sakinder’s reflections on these experiences culminated in a profound lesson: the true measure of autonomy lies not in the absence of influence but in the ability to recognize and navigate it. Whether through self-dialogue, external pressures, or unseen forces, the act of choosing—and being chosen—is an inescapable part of existence. In this interplay of freedom and force, Sakinder found a sense of empowerment, resolving to embrace the clarity it brought to his journey forward.
