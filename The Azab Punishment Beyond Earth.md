The Azab: Punishment Beyond Earth

It was a quiet summer morning in 2023, somewhere between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., when the stillness of the hour was broken. Sakinder Ali, sleeping soundly, was jolted awake. His slumber shattered by an unseen force, he sprang from his bed, driven by a primal alertness that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

As he dashed away from his bed, the world around him transformed. The familiar sounds of his home faded into a profound silence—a silence so absolute it felt like the vacuum of space. It was as if time itself had paused to witness what was about to unfold.

Suddenly,from the right corner of his bed, an invisible grip seized his neck. It was not a grip of this world, not one governed by the laws of human strength or physics. This was a force ancient and unyielding, a manifestation of pure power. The grip tightened, squeezing all of Sakinder’s senses into a single, unbearable globe. In that singularity, there was no light, no sound, no time only the overwhelming presence of judgment punishment.

In that moment, Sakinder was thrust into a globe of existence where mercy did not dwell. This was not merely a punishment of the body or the mind; it was a punishment of the soul. It was as though he had been cast into a realm outside of Earth, outside of humanity, outside of existence itself. This was the Azab, a punishment so profound and boundless that it transcended all comprehension.

Within this globe, Sakinder felt the weight of the universe collapse upon him. The punishment was timeless, stretching back to the birth of the cosmos and forward to its eventual end. It was an agony that resonated with the echoes of the Big Bang, a torment that seemed to be woven into the fabric of reality itself. Every cell of his being was held captive by a force that felt as old as creation, as infinite as the universe.

In this state, Sakinder transcended the vacuum of itself, plunging into a territory beyond any concept recognized in current science. This "nothing vacuum" was a realm devoid of even the no faintest traces of matter, energy, or temporal flow. It was a place where existence and non-existence blurred, and Sakinder’s perception expanded to encompass the incomprehensible. In this void, the linear progression of space and time disintegrated, replaced by an infinite stillness that held the potential for all things yet manifested none.

As the realm squeezed tighter, compressing his very essence, a shift occurred. Within the suffocating singularity. This insight was overwhelming, a torrent of understanding that revealed the fragile balance of morality and the profound impact of every choice.

When the grip finally released, Sakinder found himself back into subconscious. The silence of the vacuum gave way to the faint hum of the early morning. He was left shaken, and unable to comprehend the ordeal he had just endured.

One thing was clear: the Azab was no mere nightmare. It was a punishment beyond Earth, beyond time, beyond mercy. A punishment that left its mark not just on his body, but on the very essence of his being.

That summer morning became a turning point for Sakinder Ali. It marked the beginning of a journey into a new reality—one where the lines between the known and the unknown were forever blurred. Sakinder carried the memory of that cosmic punishment with him, a constant reminder of the fragility of human existence and the vast, incomprehensible power of the universe.
