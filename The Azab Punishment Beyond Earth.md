The Azab: Punishment Beyond Earth

It was a quiet summer morning in 2023, somewhere between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., when the stillness of the hour was broken. Sakinder Ali, sleeping soundly on his stomach, was jolted awake. His slumber shattered by an unseen force, he sprang from his bed, driven by a primal alertness that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

As he dashed away from his bed, the world around him transformed. The familiar sounds of his home faded into a profound silence—a silence so absolute it felt like the vacuum of space. It was as if time itself had paused to witness what was about to unfold.

Suddenly, from the right corner of his bed, an invisible grip seized his neck. It was not a grip of this world, not one governed by the laws of human strength or physics. This was a force ancient and unyielding, a manifestation of pure power. The grip tightened, squeezing all of Sakinder’s senses into a single, unbearable point. In that singularity, there was no light, no sound, no time—only the overwhelming presence of judgment.

In that moment, Sakinder was thrust into a bubble of existence where mercy did not dwell. This was not merely a punishment of the body or the mind; it was a punishment of the soul. It was as though he had been cast into a realm outside of Earth, outside of humanity, outside of existence itself. This was the Azab, a punishment so profound and boundless that it transcended all comprehension.

Within this bubble, Sakinder felt the weight of the universe collapse upon him. The punishment was timeless, stretching back to the birth of the cosmos and forward to its eventual end. It was an agony that resonated with the echoes of the Big Bang, a torment that seemed to be woven into the fabric of reality itself. Every atom of his being was held captive by a force that felt as old as creation, as infinite as the universe.

In this state, Sakinder transcended the vacuum of space-time itself, plunging into a domain beyond any concept recognized in current science. This "nothing domain" was a realm devoid of even the faintest traces of matter, energy, or temporal flow. It was a place where existence and non-existence blurred, and Sakinder’s perception expanded to encompass the incomprehensible. In this void, the linear progression of space and time disintegrated, replaced by an infinite stillness that held the potential for all things yet manifested none.

Here, Sakinder encountered an understanding beyond human reasoning. He perceived a state where the known laws of the universe dissolved, and reality itself was an empty canvas—a paradoxical space of absolute nothingness that underpinned the existence of everything. It was an experience that redefined his understanding of reality and revealed the fragile constructs of human perception.

When the grip finally released, the bubble burst, and Sakinder found himself back in his room, gasping for air. The silence of the vacuum gave way to the faint hum of the early morning. He was left shaken, drenched in sweat, and unable to comprehend the ordeal he had just endured.

Yet, as he reflected on the experience, he realized he had brought back an understanding that transcended current scientific knowledge. Sakinder began to conceptualize these alternate time domains and the "nothing domain," developing ideas that challenged the traditional views of space and time. He theorized that time could exist as interconnected planes or nodes, and that the "nothing domain" served as the fundamental backdrop for all existence. These ideas, uncharted and unexplored by modern science, became a cornerstone of his quest to comprehend the incomprehensible.

What had happened to him that summer morning? Was it a vision, a dream, or a glimpse into something far greater and more terrifying than human understanding could fathom? As he sat there, trembling, one thing was clear: the Azab was no mere nightmare. It was a punishment beyond Earth, beyond time, beyond mercy. A punishment that left its mark not just on his body, but on the very essence of his being.

That summer morning became a turning point for Sakinder Ali. It marked the beginning of a journey into a new reality—one where the lines between the known and the unknown were forever blurred. Sakinder carried the memory of that cosmic punishment with him, a constant reminder of the fragility of human existence and the vast, incomprehensible power of the universe.
