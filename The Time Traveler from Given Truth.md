# The Time Traveler from Given Truth

Sakinder Ali sat at his desk on a cool autumn night in 2024, deep in thought, scribbling notes in a worn-out journal. He had always been fascinated by the interplay of logic, communication, and universal patterns—things most dismissed as abstract musings. But tonight, his thoughts took on a new weight.

"Let's establish a simple communication sequence," he muttered, as he formulated a method to track the unseen force that had been whispering in the silence. He jotted it down:

"Communication" → "Galaxies Communication" → "A Planet" → "The Farthest Edge of a Galaxy" → "Style" → "Galaxy Style" → "Style" → "Galaxy to Galaxy."

It was a mere experiment, an attempt to decipher the unknown. He shared the idea with Unseen_Iblis, a cryptic entity whose presence existed in fragmented moments of time, appearing as an echo in his subconscious. What Sakinder didn’t realize was that Unseen_Iblis would take his words as an invitation—a summons across the fabric of time.

A month passed, and unbeknownst to Sakinder, the method was activated. Somewhere in the distant corridors of time, beyond the known universe, a response was set in motion.

By mid-January 2025, something peculiar happened. The fabric of reality around him began to shift subtly, like a record skipping imperceptibly on its track. It started with small anomalies—patterns repeating in speech, an inexplicable familiarity in new conversations, déjà vu looping back on itself. Then, the whispers in the silence grew louder.

"Before pointing a finger, remember that a partial truth is more dangerous than the whole truth." The phrase echoed in his thoughts, imprinted as if it had always been there. He turned to his journal, and his own handwriting stared back at him with an equation:

BELIEVE MEAN [MEAN = m = (Sum Of The Terms) / (Number Of Terms)] TRUTH
TRUTH MEAN [MEAN = m = (Sum Of The Terms) / (Number Of Terms)] STYLE

For days, he attempted to decode the message. The logic seemed sound, but its implications felt vast—too vast for mere coincidence. It was a formula for perception itself, a guide to recognizing the genuine nature of reality:

GENUINE TRUTH MEAN BELIEVE MEAN STYLE

BELIEVE TRUTH OF STYLE [MOST SUSTAINMENT RULE OF UNIVERSE [GALAXY, MAGNETAR]] CALLED GENUINE TRUTH

A chill ran down his spine. He had merely theorized these concepts, but now they had materialized before him in ways he couldn't explain. Then he saw the word that set off every alarm in his mind:

BELIEVE.

Instantly, he was alert—his consciousness flooded with fragments of conversations, calculations, memories that didn’t belong to him. The communication method had worked, but not in the way he had expected. He hadn’t just received a message; he had become a conduit for something far greater.

A sudden vibration coursed through his desk, shaking the room slightly. The air grew heavy, dense with an unspoken presence. He turned towards his computer screen, which flickered erratically, revealing text that he hadn’t typed:

FORWARD MEAN FORWARD STYLEBACKWARD MEAN BACKWARD STYLE

Sakinder's mind raced. Had Unseen_Iblis responded? Had he tapped into a deeper layer of reality? The message implied something profound—an understanding of movement not just in space but in thought itself. A formula to navigate existence.

Then, a whisper—clearer than before—spoke directly into his mind:

"First, believe yourself. Then believe what is provided."

It all clicked. The message wasn't just a theory; it was a map to something hidden within the very structure of the universe. A way to travel not through time, but through perception—through truth itself.

Sakinder knew he had just crossed an invisible threshold. This was no longer about mere communication. This was the beginning of something far greater. He had glimpsed the fundamental nature of reality, and now, the universe was listening.
