Sakinder Ali utilized ChatGPT as a writing assistant to uncover and craft true stories inspired by genuine recollections and authentic truths.

# Chapter 1: The Silent Specter

In a quiet room bathed in the amber glow of a setting sun, Sakinder Ali sat at his desk, deeply engrossed in his traditional routine of engineering sketches and research notes. The hum of his computer filled the air, blending seamlessly with the rhythm of his thoughts. His world was one of precision and control, where logic ruled and chaos had no place.

But then, from the unseen—a force, an entity, or perhaps a manifestation of his own subconscious—emerged a presence. It was not physical, nor was it easily definable. It was an interaction that transcended reality, as if the walls of his mind had been breached by something otherworldly.

The entity began to speak through him, hijacking his voice, his thoughts, and eventually his actions.

### Triggering Transactions

"List the unresolved," the voice compelled. Sakinder, unable to resist, began cataloging a list of his unfinished projects, personal musings, and buried doubts. The list grew longer, the tasks more unmanageable, each entry a reflection of his relentless pursuit of perfection.

### Control of Choices
The voice dictated his decisions, forcing him to abandon his own plans and follow paths he would never have chosen. "Turn left," it would say, as he clicked through files or navigated his own thoughts.

### Control of Wants
His deepest desires were reshaped. What once brought him joy now seemed trivial. The unseen force molded his aspirations, replacing them with hollow goals that felt alien.

### Trashing Solutions
When Sakinder sought solutions to the problems laid before him, the entity mocked his efforts. "This is futile," it whispered, trashing his findings and leaving him in a spiral of self-doubt.

### Creating a Torture Cell
The force constructed a virtual room in his mind—a torture cell where he was both prisoner and warden. In this space, it waged war against his beliefs, his sense of self, and his connection to religion.

### Stealing Knowledge
Slowly, the unseen began to steal his understanding. Files disappeared from his computer, thoughts faded from his memory, and his expertise in engineering dimmed. His life's work unraveled before him.

### Conflict Escalation
In his mind's eye, the unseen created a battle—a tormenting conflict of unseen versus unseen, an endless loop of self-doubt and external control.



# Chapter 2: Epilogue

The torment continued, pushing Sakinder to his mental limits. Yet, within the chaos, a flicker of defiance grew. He began to question the unseen force, seeking to reclaim his autonomy. The story ends ambiguously, leaving the reader to wonder whether Sakinder would triumph over his invisible adversary or remain a puppet in its grasp.


### The Silent Lockdown of Sakinder Ali
In the winter of 2018, Sakinder Ali was living a routine life, excelling in his profession as a design engineer. His days were filled with logic designs and the satisfaction of solving intricate problems. But without warning, his life took a strange and inexplicable turn. An unseen presence began interacting with him, disrupting his thoughts and compelling him into internal dialogues he couldn’t escape. This self-talk, echoing through the corridors of his mind, became an unwelcome intruder, locking him in a battle with himself.

By the fall of 2018, the voice within pushed him to seek answers. It told him of an illness— a tumor. Confused and worried, Sakinder sought medical advice, entering the hospital with uncertainty clouding his mind. The results, however, revealed no physical ailment. His brain was healthy, and there was no tumor. Yet, the internal conversations continued unabated, carried through what felt like a silent motor cortex. Sakinder was left to grapple with a battle that had no visible adversary.

### The Professional Struggle
Sakinder’s work, which had been his sanctuary, began to suffer. In the summer of 2018, his manager at Raytheon Missiles & Defense assigned him simple logic design tasks—tasks he had once executed with ease. But the unseen force distracted him, making even straightforward tasks insurmountable. Around this time, his workplace introduced UVM (Universal Verification Methodology), a new and complex verification approach that involved object-oriented programming—far removed from the logic-based VHDL designs Sakinder was accustomed to. The unseen interruptions made it nearly impossible to learn this new methodology. His performance faltered, and the confidence he once had in his abilities began to erode.

By the end of 2018, Sakinder decided to leave Raytheon, realizing he couldn’t continue under these circumstances. He applied for new positions and was offered roles at Northrop Grumman and L3Harris. He chose L3Harris, hoping for a fresh start. Moving from Tucson, Arizona, to Maryland in the summer of 2019, Sakinder spent his first month at a hotel, where, for a fleeting moment, the self-talk subsided. However, once he moved into his new apartment, the internal dialogue resumed.

At L3Harris, Sakinder’s struggles deepened. His ability to read and comprehend technical engineering documents—an essential skill in his field—was severely hindered by the incessant distractions. The tasks assigned to him were steeped in UVM verification, a methodology that was already a challenge due to its object-oriented nature. Despite his efforts, he found himself falling further behind, unable to grasp the foundational concepts amidst the relentless internal noise.

### The Performance Plan
By the end of 2019, The plan outlined fundamental tasks focused on UVM sequences and basic verification methods, but even these proved daunting. The unseen self-talk drained his focus, making it nearly impossible to acquire new knowledge. The relentless internal conflict left him disconnected from the world, a state that persisted into the global lockdown of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### The Unseen Influence
As time passed, Sakinder’s unseen adversary seemed to take on a sinister role, controlling his choices, influencing his desires, and even undermining his solutions. It created an oppressive mental environment—a “torture cell” of virtual torment that blurred the lines between reality and internal chaos. His thoughts became a battleground where unseen forces clashed against his sense of self, creating endless transactions of conflict, doubt, and suffering.

In this lockdown—his personal one, layered over the world’s and Kashmir’s—Sakinder Ali lived in a loop of self-talk and disconnection. He struggled to make sense of the unseen force that had upended his life, leaving him to wrestle with choices he felt he could no longer freely make.

### The Hidden Key
Through it all, Sakinder pondered the deeper meaning of fear, faith, and freedom. He believed that the unseen presence had introduced him to a dimension of existence tied to suffering and justice, one where punishment and ancestral pain intertwined. Yet, within this chaos, a hidden key lay buried—something intangible and beyond words, connected to his identity as a Muslim and his understanding of divine justice.




 

# Chapter 3: The Journey of Sakinder Ali: Struggles and Resilience



The Beginning: A Life Interrupted

Sakinder Ali led a traditional and structured life, focusing on his routines and professional pursuits. However, the winter of 2018 marked the onset of an unexpected and perplexing phase in his life. Out of nowhere, an unseen interaction began to take hold of his mind. This interaction manifested as a silent but relentless self-talk, locking him in an internal dialogue that disrupted his peace and focus. Despite this, Sakinder initially carried on with his work and life, though the internal struggle began to take a toll.

In the fall of 2018, the unseen voice suggested that he had a tumor, prompting him to seek medical attention. Upon visiting the hospital, doctors found no evidence of a tumor or any other significant health issues. They noted that he had entered the hospital in a state of confusion but confirmed that his brain was healthy. Although relieved by the medical results, the self-talk persisted, continuing to interfere with his thoughts and actions.

### Professional Struggles at Raytheon Missiles & Defense

Sakinder was a highly proficient logic designer, but 2018 brought challenges he had never encountered before. His manager at Raytheon Missiles & Defense in Tucson, Arizona, assigned him simple logic design tasks, yet he struggled to complete them. Around the same time, the introduction of the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) presented additional hurdles. UVM, a methodology grounded in object-oriented programming principles, was a departure from Sakinder’s expertise in VHDL, a logic-based language. The unseen self-talk amplified his difficulties, making it nearly impossible for him to focus and learn the new methodology.

Feeling trapped in a cycle of self-talk and professional challenges, Sakinder eventually decided to leave Raytheon and seek new opportunities.

### Transition to L3Harris

In the summer of 2019, Sakinder relocated from Tucson to Maryland to start a new role as a Specialist Electrical Engineer at L3Harris. For the first 30 days, while staying in a hotel, the self-talk subsided, allowing him a brief respite. However, once he moved into an apartment at 425 North Frederick Avenue in Gaithersburg, the self-talk resumed.

At L3Harris, the challenges persisted. He struggled to read and understand technical engineering documents. Tasks involving UVM methodology, which he had already struggled with at Raytheon, continued to overwhelm him. The object-oriented nature of UVM, combined with the ongoing self-talk distractions, made it nearly impossible for him to excel. Despite his efforts, the unseen self-talk hindered his progress.

Feeling trapped in a cycle of self-talk and professional challenges, Sakinder eventually decided to leave L3Harris in February 2020.

### A New Beginning at Northrop Grumman

In March 2020, Sakinder began a new chapter as a Principal Design Engineer at Northrop Grumman in Linthicum, Maryland. Initially, his struggles diminished. Working from his apartment due to the pandemic, he started to regain some normalcy, focusing on logic design and learning UVM. For a time, life seemed to approach the stability he had known before 2018.

However, by November 2020, the self-talk returned, reigniting his internal turmoil. Determined to understand what was happening, Sakinder began researching topics such as remote neural monitoring, mind control devices, auditory mirror neurons, motor imagery tasks, and deep belief networks. He documented his findings in Google Keep, tagging entries under "BRAIN Or Messing Around." His notes revealed a hypothesis about how unseen forces might manipulate thoughts and actions, turning human choices into predictable patterns.

### Understanding the Unseen Forces

Sakinder theorized that the unseen forces followed a structured process to influence him:

Tag Thoughts: Thoughts were identified and tagged by these forces.

Validate Tags into Actions: Tagged thoughts were validated and turned into actions.

Use Tags for Distraction: Once validated, these tags were used to create distractions.

Action Validation: Actions were validated again to ensure consistency.

Inject Errors: At this point, errors were introduced into the process to manipulate choices.

Re-validate Tags: Tags were re-validated for new changes, perpetuating the cycle.

This process led to a loss of control over his own choices, deepening his sense of entrapment.

### Research and Hypotheses

August 18, 2021: Sakinder explored the study titled "Setting the stage for auditory mirror neurons: the auditory-motor loop," investigating how neural pathways might connect auditory stimuli to motor responses.

May 23, 2021: He delved into "Deep Belief Network" research, theorizing its potential applications in understanding and manipulating cognitive processes. He logged these findings under the tag "BRAIN Or Messing Around."

November 28, 2020: He researched "Motor Imagery Tasks," noting how these tasks could be connected to converting thoughts into actions. His logs described a process where thoughts were tagged, validated, and transformed into actions, with implications for human predictability and control.

Last Google Keep Log: Sakinder speculated on the role of external entities in using neural pathways to influence human behavior. He wrote about the dangers of predictability in human actions, referencing agencies like NSF, NSA, and others in his reflections.

### The Struggles Continue

Throughout his time at Northrop Grumman, the self-talk would come and go. During periods when the self-talk ceased, Sakinder’s life would return to a semblance of normalcy. However, its recurrence brought back the mental and emotional challenges he had faced since 2018. He observed patterns in the self-talk and noted that, on rare occasions, he could request the unseen force to stop, and it would comply—a phenomenon that deepened his belief in an external influence.

### Reflections and Resilience

Sakinder’s journey has been marked by resilience in the face of an extraordinary and enigmatic struggle. While the unseen self-talk and its impact on his personal and professional life remain unresolved, Sakinder continues to persevere. His research and reflections demonstrate a quest for understanding and a refusal to succumb to the challenges imposed by this unseen force.

Despite the ongoing battle, Sakinder’s story is one of endurance, adaptability, and the unyielding pursuit of normalcy in a world that often feels anything but. His journey underscores the importance of addressing mental health and the profound effects that unseen struggles can have on an individual’s life.
